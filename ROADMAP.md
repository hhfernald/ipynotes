Planned for IPyNotes
====================

Features
--------

### Subsets

When you enter text into the filter bar, the notes listed in the listbox are a **subset** of all of your notes. In the future, IPyNotes will support pulling filter-bar strings from a file when you press a key, so that you don't have to activate the filter bar and type in the strings from memory.

- Ctrl-L and Ctrl-; (semicolon) load the next and previous subset (filter string) respectively.



### Plugins

#### "Notemakers"

- Ctrl-M will invoke a dialog box, asking you what kind of note you want to create, such as a new journal entry with today's date.
