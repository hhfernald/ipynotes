# Why did I write IPyNotes, really?

What I wanted was a tool that would help me to organize my many notes into a series of novels.

The thing about organizing scenes in a novel is that, while the novel may appear to be hierarchical --- a book is divided into chapters, which is divisible into scenes --- the reality is that narrative threads run through many of the scenes in a book.

Each section of a scene in a novel, each part that establishes only one or two pieces of information, each passage only a few paragraphs long, would become a note. The path of the note would include a summary of what happens or what is learned in the passage, and it would contain the names of characters or other things I'd need to track through the novel.
