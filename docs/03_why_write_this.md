# Why did I write IPyNotes, really?

What I wanted was a tool that would help me to organize my many notes into a series of novels.

The thing about organizing scenes in a novel is that, while the novel may appear to be hierarchical --- a book is divided into chapters, which is divisible into scenes --- the reality is that narrative threads run through many of the scenes in a book. For the sake of continuity, you have to keep track of what characters do and what happens to them, where object are and what's done with them, the locations of things, and (sometimes) the development of ideas or themes. When you're writing a science fiction or fantasy novel with its own fictional world and its own rules, this tracking becomes even more important.

My own view of a novel is that each scene, each passage, can be broken down into discrete *points*. A point is a section, usually only a few lines or paragraphs long, that establishes one main piece of information: Something happens, or something is said or established or learned.

It isn't always necessary to break every scene down into points. You enumerate points when another part of the story may refer back to them in some way. If the scene is just a fight scene or a love scene where it isn't important to remember later precisely who did what to whom or with what, then you needn't bother to list these details as points.

In my own setup, each point would become a note. The note name would contain the names of the characters mentioned and a quick headline-style summary of what happens or what is learned, and likely a keyword about something else I want to track.

Once I have all of my points set down, I can use the filter bar to show only the notes with a specific character or idea and read the note names to verify that everything is there that should be there, and that I haven't made any continuity errors or left any plotlines dangling.
